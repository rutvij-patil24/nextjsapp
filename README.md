# ✅ Next.js Todo App

A beautifully styled, full-featured Todo App built using **Next.js 14 App Router**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

This project demonstrates modern full-stack app development using the latest Next.js features including client components, Tailwind UI, keyboard events, custom styling, and interactive state management.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- [**Next.js 14**](https://nextjs.org) – App Router, Server/Client Components, File-based routing
- [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) – Strongly typed JS for maintainable code
- [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com) – Utility-first CSS with full customization
- [**React Hooks**](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) – State & event handling
- [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com) – Montserrat for headings, Poppins for body text

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Add tasks using either the **"Add" button** or by pressing **Enter**
- ✅ Toggle tasks between **active** (green background) and **completed** (red strikethrough)
- ✅ Tasks are cleanly styled with spacing and hover feedback
- ✅ Custom theme with consistent font pairing and colors
- ✅ Fully responsive layout using Tailwind
- ✅ Modular code with reusable components and type safety

## 💡 How I Built It / My Approach

This project was built with a **scalable architecture** and focus on **clarity and user experience**. Here's how I approached it:

- **Component-based Design** – Reusable `TodoList` and `TodoItem` components
- **State Management** – Used `useState` to track and toggle todos
- **UX Focus** – Input auto-focus, `Enter` key support, clear interaction feedback
- **Tailwind Theming** – Fonts and colors defined in Tailwind config for consistency
- **Font Loading** – Used `next/font/google` to load Montserrat & Poppins the Next.js way
- **Accessibility & Keyboard UX** – Enter-to-add and large touch targets
